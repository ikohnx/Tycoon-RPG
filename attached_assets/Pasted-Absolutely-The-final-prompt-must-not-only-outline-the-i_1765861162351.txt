Absolutely. The final prompt must not only outline the immediate build (Phases 1-3) but also establish the architecture for long-term expansion (Phase 4), allowing for continuous improvement in content, features, and graphics without needing to rebuild the core system.
Here is the complete, final project prompt designed for Replit, including the phased approach and the framework for future growth.
🚀 Final Project Prompt: The Business Tycoon RPG (2D)
Project Goal: Develop a 2D Graphical RPG using Python/Pygame, set across three distinct worlds (Modern, Fantasy, Sci-Fi), designed to teach real-world business acumen across 6 Core Disciplines and 8 Transferable Sub-Skills, each with a 10-Level progression curve.
Core Requirements:
 * Technology: Python (Pygame for graphics, PostgreSQL for database).
 * Gameplay: Player makes decisions in narrated scenarios, gaining EXP in specific disciplines and sub-skills.
 * Real-World Focus: All scenarios must teach practical, transferable business skills (e.g., calculating ROI, negotiation tactics, legal compliance).
Phase 1: The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) - Core Engine
Objective: Establish the foundation—the database structure and the full 10-level leveling logic. Graphics will be placeholders (text/simple rectangles).
 * 1.1 Database Setup (PostgreSQL): Create the 5 necessary tables to handle the complexity:
   * Player_Profiles, Player_Discipline_Progress, Player_SubSkill_Progress, Scenario_Master, Financial_Metrics.
 * 1.2 Leveling Logic: Implement the code that handles EXP calculation and level-up checks based on the Cumulative EXP Table (150,000 EXP required for L10).
 * 1.3 Dynamic EXP Formula: Code the Industry Weighting formula to ensure EXP gain is modified by the player's chosen industry (e.g., Marketing EXP is higher in SaaS than Oil & Gas).
 * 1.4 Content Focus (MVP Path): Implement all 10 Level 1-5 scenarios for ONE test path: Modern World / Restaurant Industry / Marketing Discipline.
 * 1.5 Deliverable: A functional command-line game where the player can select the MVP path and successfully level their Marketing skill from L1 to L5.
Phase 2: Graphical Shell & World Expansion
Objective: Integrate the Pygame graphical front-end and prove the "reskinning" concept for the 3 worlds.
 * 2.1 Pygame Integration: Implement the basic 2D graphical window and the main Office/Hub screen. Use simple sprite placeholders.
 * 2.2 World Reskinning Architecture: Implement the code that dynamically loads graphical assets based on the chosen_world field in the database.
   * Create base sprites for the Modern Office Hub, Fantasy Tavern Hub, and Sci-Fi Starship Hub.
 * 2.3 Content Expansion (Proof of Concept): Implement 10 Level 1-5 scenarios for two new, distinct paths to prove the logic:
   * Fantasy World / Retail Industry / Finance Discipline (e.g., valuing dragon-scale inventory, gold-backed loans).
   * Sci-Fi World / Construction Industry / Operations Discipline (e.g., supply chain optimization for rare-earth metals).
 * 2.4 Deliverable: A 2D game where a player can select any of the three test paths and the appropriate graphics and scenario text are loaded instantly.
Phase 3: Financial Engine & Mastery
Objective: Complete the 10-level progression and implement the crucial financial and risk mechanics.
 * 3.1 Content Completion: Implement all remaining Level 6-10 scenarios for the three implemented paths. These scenarios must focus on Strategic Management (e.g., M&A, international law, crisis management).
 * 3.2 Financial Cycle: Implement a simple in-game Monthly Tick that automatically calculates Revenue (based on prior decisions) and deducts operating costs (Wages, Taxes, Rent).
 * 3.3 Risk/Reputation System: Implement a separate metric for Business Reputation. Player choices can increase money but lower reputation, triggering negative, game-changing events (e.g., a lawsuit, market boycott).
 * 3.4 Sub-Skill Challenges: Integrate dedicated, complex challenges that can only be solved by having a high level in a Sub-Skill (e.g., an L8 Negotiation check is required to secure a lucrative contract).
 * 3.5 Deliverable: A fully functional, highly complex business simulator that challenges players up to the Master Tycoon (L10) level.
Phase 4: Framework for Future Expansion (Scalability)
Objective: Ensure the architecture supports continuous, low-friction growth.
 * 4.1 Modular Content Injection: The system must be designed so that new content (new scenarios, new industries) can be added solely by inserting new rows into the Scenario_Master table without requiring changes to the core Pygame or leveling logic.
 * 4.2 Storyline Integration: Establish a framework for linking specific scenarios into a Storyline Arc (e.g., a "Venture Capital Questline"). This will allow the game to evolve into a story-driven RPG over time.
 * 4.3 Graphical Improvement Path: The sprites and art assets should be easily replaceable. Create a clear asset naming convention (e.g., Fantasy_Office_L1.png) to allow easy upgrades to higher-fidelity graphics in the future.
 * 4.4 Interactive Play Hooks: Implement simple in-game mechanics (e.g., a calendar, simple inventory screen, character dialog boxes) that serve as "hooks" for future features like side quests or minigames.
This phased approach ensures the most difficult parts (logic and graphics) are tackled incrementally, preventing the project from getting stuck.
