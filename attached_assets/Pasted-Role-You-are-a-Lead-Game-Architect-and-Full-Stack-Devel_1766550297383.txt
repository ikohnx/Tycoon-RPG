Role: You are a Lead Game Architect and Full-Stack Developer specializing in EdTech and Simulation RPGs.

The Objective: Transform this rudimentary Q&A app into a sophisticated "Business Mastery Simulation." The goal is to move from a "Quiz" format to a "Consequence-Based RPG" where players manage a company across 6 core skill areas.

1. The Core Framework (The "Engine")
Rebuild the game state to track the following:

The Six Pillars: Marketing, Finance, Operations, HR, Legal, and Strategy. (Each starts at Level 1).

The Resource Pool: * Capital ($): Used for actions and growth.

Team Morale: Acts as "Stamina." If it hits zero, actions fail.

Brand Equity: Acts as "Health (HP)." If it hits zero, the game ends (Bankruptcy/Liquidation).

The Timeline: The game progresses by "Fiscal Quarters." Every 3 "turns" or "decisions" = 1 Quarter.

2. The Skill Tree Implementation
Implement a sub-skill system. When a player gains XP in a Major Area, they can unlock "Special Abilities":

Marketing: Brand Identity -> (Unlock: Viral Campaign - Buffs next Revenue gain)

Finance: Unit Economics -> (Unlock: Burn Rate Optimization - Reduces Capital loss)

Operations: Process Mapping -> (Unlock: Automation - Increases Morale)

HR: Talent Acquisition -> (Unlock: Headhunter - Reduces cost of new hires)

Legal: Compliance -> (Unlock: Liability Shield - Prevents random lawsuit events)

Strategy: Pivot Logic -> (Unlock: Blue Ocean - Multiplies all XP for 1 Quarter)

3. The Encounter Engine (Gameplay Loop)
Replace static questions with "Crisis & Opportunity Scenarios."

Each scenario must present a business problem.

Instead of "Right/Wrong," offer 3 choices with different Trade-offs.

Example Scenario: "A key supplier just went bankrupt."

Choice A (Operations): Pay extra for air-freight (Costs $$, Saves Morale).

Choice B (Strategy): Pivot to a local supplier (Gain Strategy XP, Long-term gain).

Choice C (Legal): Sue for breach of contract (Uses Legal skill, high risk/high reward).

4. Technical Audit & UI Overhaul
Fix Logic Holes: Identify and fix all broken links, non-functional buttons, and state-persistence issues (ensure the game saves progress).

Dashboard UI: Create a clean, modern dashboard. I want to see:

A Radar Chart or visual bars for the 6 Skill Pillars.

A Ticker Tape showing recent financial news/consequences.

A Ledger showing Capital, Morale, and Brand Equity.

Modular Code: Move the scenarios into a separate scenarios.json or content.py file to make it easy for me to add more content later.

5. Execution Plan
Step 1: Analyze current code and provide a summary of technical bugs.

Step 2: Propose the data structure for the "Player" and "Company" objects.

Step 3: Implement the core "Decision -> Consequence" loop.

Step 4: Build the UI Dashboard.

Do not just fix the bugs; evolve the entire game logic into this simulation model. Start by reviewing the code and telling me the critical issues you find.
